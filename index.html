<h1>New Look!</h1>
<p>Welcome to <i>www.PENETRATIONTEST.com!</i></p>

<p>
Things sure are looking different around here! In our second quarter meeting, a member of our planning team remembered something they were asked in a business development course:
<p id="marketquote">
		"What would your customers create if they were<br>
		given total control of your marketing?"</p>
<p>
This is a question that doesn't get asked anywhere near often enough. So we did. We asked a whole lot of our prized customers what they would hope to see on a website like ours. Then we set out to build it. We couldn't be happier with what we've come up with. And we're pretty sure you will be too.</p>
<p>
The number one request was that our customers want to see a more balanced approach to the technical and human elements of Information Security. Nobody needs yet another technical HOWTO when simply googling a specific topic will provide endless amounts of exactly the same information repackaged to look like original content. Especially when that information confuzingly sticks around well past it's expiry date. The direction you want to see is loud and clear.</p>
<p>
One of our favourite new addition is the Dossier. It's not a blog. It's not a magazine. We can't say too much about it until it is ready to launch in May. It is looking amazing. Watch here for the announcements!

<ul class="box">

</ul></p>

<p id="singlecontent">
One of the benefits <i>www.PENETRATIONTEST.com</i> enjoys from being directly involved in the Information Security business for almost 2 decades, is that we have played an integral role helping businesses keep up with the constantly changing threatscape. We've worked with companies ranging from tens of employees to Fortune 50 and 500 companies whose numbers are in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p id="singlecontent">
All this exposure has given us a holistic view and approach to securing information. To us, security is part of the overall process that governs the most successful of organizations. There are three core ways we make secure operations a reality for our customers:
</p>

<ul class="singlecolpointlist">
<li><strong><u>Examine</u></strong> - This is our core competancy - what we've been doing the world over for 17 years. At the turn of the century, we developed the Offensive Operations Model as the framework to set a consistent and demonstrably high level of success in our penetration testing, auditing and social engineering engagements. The Offensive Operations Model is published by IEEE under document 0.1109/ICTTA.2004.1307886. A number of standards have appeared since, but the Offensive Operations Model is the only one that can withstand the test of time, and used to audit the others.</li>
<li><strong><u>Enforce</u></strong> - Maintaining a high degree of Information Security is all about having appropriate controls everywhere information is processed, stored, or transferred. Our Information Security Advisors pride themselves on working with some of the most advanced knowlege and techniques available to develop and maintain thorough and consistent information security at the management, operational and technical levels.</li>
<li><strong><u>Empower</u></strong> - You hired a great team based on each person's ability to deliver the results you need for your company to succeed. But chances are, Information Security was not part of their training. Consultants and advisors from <i>www.PENETRATIONTEST.com</i> deliver some of the most pertinent training available. We have taught at colleges and universities around the globe as well as in Fortune 500 and Fortune 50 education facilities. We also provide customized training to companies of all sizes. We also do public speaking engagements covering many Information Security subjects. Our advisors do keynote speeches at technical tradeshows and have appeared in numerous blogs, news programs, magazines and so on.</li>
</ul>

<p id="singlecontent">
The year 2014 began as the first time the general public fully understood how every aspect of the information lifecycle cannot leave our immediate control. Everywhere information is stored, processed or transported without stringent security controls represents an opportunity for someone - Friend or Foe (we no longer can tell) - to exploit it for their own purposes. Our experts will help you gain and maintain that control.</p>

<p id="singlecontent">
Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@penetrationtest.com">info@penetrationtest.com</a> to discuss how we can help you get there.
